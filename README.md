         <p>Baking is a really hard hobby but most peeople like it.Personaly, I love baking...though 50% of the times I bake I complitly fail.Surly, some people are better than me at baking, but I love making sweets and I'll continue doing it!!</p>
         <p>My favourite things to bake are a lot... some of them are:donuts, cookies, chocolate chip bread, lava cake, croisants, mini cupcakes, cupcakes and many others.I also like sweets that dont need the oven, like tangulus(a chinese sugar sweet), lolipops, strwaberries dipped in milk chocolate, bananas dipped in milk chocolate...Everyone has his own favorites!!</p>
